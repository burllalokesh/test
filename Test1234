Low Risk Findings

RTA-L-01: User Identity Enumeration

Risk: Low

Impact: Low

Exploitability: High

Description

Mandiant observed that the affected endpoint returned differing responses when an incorrect username was submitted and when a valid username was submitted. The condition allowed Mandiant to enumerate valid usemames, emails, and contact information for DCCU employees and administrative accounts. Systems that provide login functionality often associate a unique identity with each user authorized to access the system. The unique identity usually serves as a component required to be supplied when performing login actions, account recovery actions, and identity proofing actions.
